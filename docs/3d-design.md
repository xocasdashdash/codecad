# 3D in CodeCAD: design

Status: proposal (2026-10-13). The build-out plan is [LADDER-3D.md](LADDER-3D.md).
The native desktop shell that later hosts the same 3D viewport is
[LADDER-NATIVE.md](LADDER-NATIVE.md).

CodeCAD gets solid parts made from CAD primitives (extrude, revolve, sweep,
loft, booleans, roundovers). They live in the same document as the 2D
drawing and sync over the same Yrs channel. A 3D viewport renders them, from
an interactive raster view up to a progressive path tracer. Parts project
back into exact 2D geometry, so the existing 2D tooling (dimensions, title
block, DWG export) produces the shop drawing. Everything stays in Rust,
compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, and runs the same code on both peers.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

1. **Building and DIY modelling with CAD primitives.** The workhorse is the
   flat part: a 2D profile, a thickness and a placement (a shelf, a side, a
   plywood back, a slab). Around it: revolve (turned legs), sweep (handrails,
   mouldings), loft and taper (tapered legs), booleans for joinery (dados,
   rabbets, mortises, holes), and edge roundovers and chamfers.
2. **Accuracy you can trust.** The 3D model is used to check the 2D work
   against reality, so the 2D abstract-geometry rule applies here too. The
   document stores the exact feature tree and the kernel evaluates exact
   analytic B-rep. Tessellation happens only at render time and adapts to
   zoom. Volumes, distances and cut-list dimensions come from exact geometry,
   never from a mesh.
3. **3D to 2D for manufacturing.** The output is orthographic views, sections
   with hatching, hidden lines and dimensions, written into the 2D `Document`
   as ordinary entities. Also a cut list for flat parts.
4. **Good-looking renders.** PBR materials (wood, concrete, paint, glass),
   HDRI image-based lighting, a progressive path tracer with global
   illumination, and filmic tone mapping (AgX or Khronos PBR Neutral).
5. **Assets for context.** External glTF/GLB models (plants, chairs, people)
   are placed by reference with a transform. They appear in renders and as
   optional plan symbols. They are excluded from projection, cut lists and
   DWG.
6. **Same ABI.** Everything goes through `cad_call` and `web/src/cad-api.ts`
   (`cad.extrude`, `cad.revolve`, `cad.subtract`, `cad.placeAsset`,
   `cad.project`, `cad.render`, ...), so agents, the sandbox and the browser
   share one API.

### Non-goals (for this design)

- A general mechanical CAD system. There are no assemblies with mates or
  joints, no sketch constraint solver, no sheet metal and no surfacing
  beyond sweep and loft.
- Interactive 3D direct modelling (push/pull with the mouse). Creation is
  scripted, with a simple pick-and-inspect UI. Interactive tools can come
  later on top of the same feature tree.
- STEP/IGES import as a first-class workflow. The chosen kernel can read
  STEP; exposing it is an open question (§13), not a rung.
- Live associative drawings. Projected views are regenerated on request
  (`cad.project` again, or a "refresh views" button), not on every edit.
- Hardware ray tracing. WebGPU has none, and the path tracer runs as
  compute shaders.
- C++ kernels (OpenCascade and its bindings), by decision.

## 2. Verification summary (evidence)

Each claim from the brief was checked on 2026-10-13 against crates.io, the
GitHub API, the repositories and, where cheap, a compile-and-run smoke test.
The smoke-test sources are in [research/3d-smoke/](research/3d-smoke/)
(see its README for how to rerun them). All of them model the same test part: a
600 x 300 x 18 mm board, minus a Ø10 through hole, minus a 12 x 6 dado along
its length. That is two booleans. The closed-form volume is
**3 195 386.283 mm³**. With all 12 edges rounded at r = 3 before the cuts,
it is **3 188 376.6 mm³** (Minkowski box plus the dado-end correction).
Builds used `opt-level = "s"`, LTO and `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, and the
wasm was run in Node with stubbed imports.

### Kernels

| Kernel | Status (verified) | Smoke result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[ogeom](https://github.com/gilbertorconde/ogeom-rs)** ([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ogeom) 0.10.0, MIT/Apache-2.0) | Pure-Rust B-rep with a data model like OCCT's (shared topology, per-entity tolerance, operation history). Has booleans, fillets and chamfers (with vertex blends), extrude/revolve/sweep/loft, offset/shell, **HLR (polygonal and exact), sections with hatch**, STEP/IGES/STL. Repo created 2026-08-04 (first crates.io release 2026-09-18), so about ten weeks old, with about 222 k LoC and 1 309 commits by one author (2 by others), 4 stars, near-daily releases. | Native: plain board in 5-12 ms, **exact volume 3 195 386.283**, valid B-rep, 11 faces. Rounded board (12-edge fillet, then 2 cuts) in 0.7-1.1 s, valid B-rep, 33 faces, **volume 3 188 376.635** (matches closed form). Front-view HLR: 55 visible and 46 hidden curves in 9 ms. **wasm: builds, no imports at all, 3.2 MB (1.08 MB gzip), rounded board runs in 3.3 s in Node.** | **Primary backend**, behind a trait, pinned, with a second backend for differential tests. Young, single maintainer and mostly machine-written, so §5 covers the mitigations. |
| **[Truck](https://github.com/ricosjp/truck)** (truck-modeling 0.6.0, truck-shapeops 0.4.0, Apache-2.0) | Mature B-rep/NURBS kernel (ricosjp, 1.6 k stars). The last crates.io release was **2024-09-20**. Master is active, though since mid-2026 mostly weekly `cargo upgrade` merges. The unreleased master adds a **single-edge fillet** (low-level, face-based, outside `truck_modeling::Solid`), `EdgeBlendSurface`, offsets and a new 2D `truck-drafting` crate ([CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ricosjp/truck/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)). | Native: 2 booleans in 344-389 ms, 13 faces. Mesh volume converges to the exact value (3 195 386.538 at tol 0.001). **wasm: builds, 949 KB (260 KB gzip), runs in 1.37 s**. It needs the wasm-bindgen placeholder imports, and rayon falls back to one thread. Master fillet tests (`create_simple_fillet`, `create_fillet_with_side`) pass. | **Secondary backend** for differential testing and the fallback if ogeom stalls. It has no usable roundovers through its released API. |
| **[vcad-kernel](https://github.com/ecto/vcad)** 0.10.0 | B-rep with fillet, shell, sweep and loft, plus a sprawling umbrella crate (it pulls in `qcd`, `neutronics`, `photonics`, ...). crates.io says MIT and the GitHub repo says Apache-2.0. | Plain board: **analytic B-rep**, volume 3 195 386.66 (mesh). Rounded board: works, but the result's `fidelity()` is **`TriangleSoup`**: booleans after a fillet silently fell back to mesh CSG. `Solid::difference` is documented to return the target **unchanged** on a kernel error. wasm: 1.3 MB, runs in 1.2 s. | Rejected. Silent degradation to a mesh breaks the accuracy goal. |
| **[csgrs](https://github.com/timschmidt/csgrs)** | crates.io 0.20.1 (2025-07) **no longer resolves**: it hard-depends on `core2 ^0.4`, whose only version is yanked. Main is an unreleased 0.23 rewrite on exact-arithmetic "hyper*" crates. | On main: box minus box is fine, and box minus an 8-segment cylinder is fine. **Box minus a cylinder with ≥ 16 segments fails** with `predicate could not be decided: Real sign classification`. | Rejected for now. It was mesh-based anyway, so wrong for the accuracy goal. |
| **[Fornjot](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot)** | **Archived.** The README says the project "has been shut down". The last push was 2026-06-19, which fits "discontinued June 2026". | n/a | Excluded. |
| **[BREP.io](https://github.com/mmiscool/BREP.io)** (mmiscool) | **TypeScript**, not Rust. Triangle meshes with B-rep-style topology. The license is custom ("Autodrop3d LLC", reported as NOASSERTION). | n/a | Excluded (not Rust, not exact). |
| opencascade-rs | C++ | n/a | Excluded by decision. |

### Renderers

| Renderer | Status (verified) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **[Kiss3d](https://github.com/dimforge/kiss3d) 0.47.0** (2026-10-04, BSD-3-Clause) | The claim holds, and it goes further than the brief said. **wgpu 30**. PBR StandardMaterial (clearcoat, anisotropy, transmission). **Equirectangular HDRI skybox + IBL**. Shadow maps, SSAO, OIT. Linear HDR film with **AgX, ACES, Khronos PBR Neutral (default) and Tony McMapface** tone mapping. A **progressive Monte-Carlo path tracer** (`RayTracer`) with one WGSL kernel and two backends: a software **compute BVH** (works on WebGPU) and a HW ray-query backend picked at runtime. It has a two-level BVH, MIS with area lights, HDRI IBL and an à-trous denoiser. `OffscreenSurface` renders headless natively and **on wasm** (GPU side), and `output_view` exposes the tone-mapped texture. `Context::init(instance, device, queue, adapter, format)` **accepts an external device**. glTF loader. Mostly one author (sebcrozet, 655 commits). The path tracer is about 1.7 k lines of WGSL. Source: [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dimforge/kiss3d/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). | **Adopted** as the 3D render backend behind our own trait (§9). The "dry renders" concern becomes a gate in 3D5b: a look bake-off against a Cycles reference. If it fails, we fork its BSD-3 tracer kernel into our crate rather than starting from zero. |
| [Renderling](https://github.com/schell/renderling) | "Alpha", NLnet-funded, actively pushed (2026-10-11). **crates.io 0.4.9 dates from 2024-09**, and main is an unreleased 0.6.0. **Main is on wgpu 26**, while Vello 0.11 and Kiss3d are on wgpu 30, so it **cannot share a device with Vello** without an upstream bump. PBR, IBL, shadows and bloom, but **no path tracer**. Main builds for wasm32 (our smoke test). | Not adopted. The earlier recommendation is revised. |
| Bevy 0.20 (2026-10-08) | A full engine that owns the app loop. Its ray-traced GI (Solari) needs **hardware** ray tracing, which WebGPU lacks ([0.17 notes](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-17/), [0.20 notes](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-20/)). MSRV 1.97. | Too heavy to embed, and its GI is not available on the web. |
| three-d 0.19 | OpenGL/WebGL (glow), so it cannot share a wgpu device with Vello. | Excluded. |
| rend3 | [Archived](https://github.com/BVE-Reborn/rend3), "maintenance mode", last push 2024-07-08. The archive date (claimed June 2025) is not visible through the API. | Excluded. |
| "threers", "Penumbra" | **Not found** on crates.io, GitHub search or the web under these names. | Unverified, ignored. |

### Compatibility facts that shape the design

- **One wgpu across the stack is possible today.** `vello 0.11`,
  `kiss3d 0.47` and `eframe/egui-wgpu 0.36.2` all depend on **wgpu 30**, and
  `egui_dock 0.21.1` depends on `egui ^0.36` (not on wgpu directly), so it
  follows eframe. A native smoke crate with all of them plus
  `wtransport 0.7.2` compiles with **no duplicate wgpu, winit or vello**. It
  hands one `egui_wgpu::RenderState` device to both `vello::Renderer::new`
  and `kiss3d::context::Context::init`. A wasm32 smoke crate with
  `kiss3d 0.47` and `vello 0.11` compiles and resolves to a single
  `wgpu v30.0.1`. CodeCAD is on vello 0.9 / wgpu 29 today, and `cadview-web`'s
  `eframe/egui 0.34` (the fallback renderer) also pins `wgpu ^29`. So
  **bumping vello 0.9 → 0.11 and eframe/egui 0.34 → 0.36 together is a
  prerequisite** (rung 3D2a and N0a). Bumping only one leaves two wgpu
  majors in the web bundle.
- The current browser bundle is 24 MB of wasm. ogeom adds about 3.2 MB raw
  (1.1 MB gzip).
- The research machine had no GPU and no Vulkan driver, so **no GPU render
  was run**.
  All renderer evidence is compile-level plus the documentation. Rungs 3D2b
  and 3D5a/3D5b must prove the runtime behaviour.

```

The core-first rule holds. The feature tree, evaluation, tessellation,
projection, cut lists and interference all live in core and run identically
in the browser, on the server and in the sandbox. Only GPU code lives
outside core, in `cadview-render3d`, which both shells share.

## 4. Data model

### 4.1 Types (cadview-core `solid/`)

```rust
/// A reusable solid definition in its own local frame (millimetres, f64).
pub struct PartDef {
    pub id: DefId,
    pub name: String,                  // "shelf", "side"
    pub kind: PartKind,                // Flat { thickness, grain: GrainDir } | Turned | General
    pub features: Vec<Feature>,        // ordered, evaluated top to bottom
}

/// A placed occurrence of a definition: what the user sees and selects.
pub struct Part {
    pub id: EntityId,                  // same id space as 2D entities, stable u64
    pub def: DefId,
    pub placement: Placement,          // rotation (unit quaternion) + translation, f64
    pub material: Option<String>,      // None = layer's material
    pub layer: String,                 // layers work in 3D too: visibility, material default
    pub label: Option<String>,         // cut-list name override ("shelf 2")
}

pub enum Feature {
    Extrude  { id: FeatId, profile: Profile2d, plane: Plane3, distance: f64,
               taper_deg: f64, op: Op },
    Revolve  { id: FeatId, profile: Profile2d, plane: Plane3, axis: Line2, angle_deg: f64, op: Op },
    Sweep    { id: FeatId, profile: Profile2d, path: Path3, op: Op },
    Loft     { id: FeatId, sections: Vec<(Profile2d, Plane3)>, ruled: bool, op: Op },
    Hole     { id: FeatId, at: Point3, dir: Vec3, dia: f64, depth: Depth, cbore: Option<(f64, f64)> },
    Boolean  { id: FeatId, op: Op, tool: ToolRef },             // joinery
    Fillet   { id: FeatId, edges: EdgeSel, radius: f64, fallback: RoundFallback },
    Chamfer  { id: FeatId, edges: EdgeSel, d1: f64, d2: f64 },
}

pub enum Op { Add, Subtract, Intersect }

/// A tool body for a boolean: another part as placed in the scene (joinery:
/// "cut the shelf's shape into the side"), or an inline def.
pub enum ToolRef { Part { part: EntityId, clearance: f64 }, Def(DefId, Placement) }

/// The 2D section of a feature, using the same exact primitives as 2D Shapes:
/// lines, arcs, bulge polylines, circles, ellipses, splines. Never flattened.
pub struct Profile2d { pub outer: Vec<Seg2>, pub holes: Vec<Vec<Seg2>> }

/// Edge selection by meaning, not by kernel topology (see 4.3).
pub enum EdgeSel {
    Cap { feature: FeatId, side: CapSide /* Start | End | Both */, segs: Option<Vec<usize>> },
    Lateral { feature: FeatId, segs: Vec<usize> },  // edges swept from profile vertices
    Near { points: Vec<Point3> },                   // resolved to the nearest edges at eval
    All,
}

pub enum RoundFallback { Error, Visual }   // Visual = render-only bevel + 2D note

pub struct Material {
    pub name: String,                  // "oak", "birch-ply-18", "concrete"
    pub pbr: Pbr,                      // base colour, roughness, metallic, clearcoat, ...
    pub textures: Option<AssetKey>,    // store key of a PBR texture set (Poly Haven)
    pub section_hatch: HatchSpec,      // pattern, angle, spacing for sections
    pub stock: Option<StockSpec>,      // nominal thickness, sheet size, grain: for cut lists
}

pub struct AssetRef {
    pub id: EntityId,
    pub key: AssetKey,                 // document-store key, e.g. "assets/polyhaven/potted_plant_01.glb"
    pub placement: Placement,
    pub scale: f64,
    pub layer: String,
    pub plan_symbol: PlanSymbol,       // None | Footprint | Block(name)
}
```

Profiles reuse the 2D geometry types (kurbo `Line`/`Arc`, LwPolyline bulges,
circles, splines). `cad.extrude` can therefore take existing 2D entity ids,
which makes "draw the outline in 2D, then extrude it" natural and keeps the
profile exact.

### 4.2 Yrs mapping

Five new YMaps sit beside `entities`, `layers`, `blocks`, `linetypes` and
`meta`. They use the existing pattern: one bincode blob per key, so a
mutation is one map write and diffs stay small.

| YMap | Key | Value (bincode) | Typical size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `partdefs` | `DefId` | `PartDef` (feature list, profiles) | 0.2-5 KB |
| `parts` | `EntityId` | `Part` (def ref, placement, material, layer) | ~100 B |
| `materials` | name | `Material` | ~200 B |
| `assets` | `EntityId` | `AssetRef` | ~150 B |
| `scene3d` | `"default"` / view names | camera bookmarks, HDRI key, exposure, tone map | ~200 B |

The **feature tree is the only synced geometry**. B-reps, meshes, BVHs and
textures are derived, never synced, and cached by content hash on each peer.
Both peers run the same kernel code, so they evaluate the same tree to the
same B-rep up to floating-point determinism. Nothing depends on bit
equality: selections are semantic (4.3), and projected 2D views are written
back as ordinary entities by whichever peer ran `cad.project`.

Conflict granularity matches 2D: concurrent edits to the same `PartDef` are
last-writer-wins on that def, and edits to different parts merge. This is
fine for scripted, agent-driven work. A finer split (features as a YArray)
is possible later without changing the API.

DWG export ignores all five maps. DWG save stays byte-identical for a
document whose 2D content is unchanged, and rung 3D1a tests this. JSON
`cad.save` includes them.

### 4.3 Stable references (the "topological naming" problem)

Fillets, chamfers and dimension anchors need to name edges and faces across
re-evaluation. We **never store kernel edge ids**. Selections are expressed
against our own feature tree:

- `Cap{feature, side, segs}`: edges of an extrude's start or end cap,
  indexed by **profile segment index**. We own the profile, so the index is
  stable. "Round over the top front edge" is `Cap{f1, End, [2]}`.
- `Lateral{feature, segs}`: edges swept from profile vertices.
- `Near{points}`: picks the nearest edge at evaluation time. It is robust to
  small edits, and the API uses it when a script picks by coordinates.

The kernel adapter resolves selectors after each feature, using operation
history (ogeom returns a `History` on every op) to follow edges through
later booleans. A selector that no longer resolves is an evaluation error
with a clear message. It never silently picks a different edge.

### 4.4 Placement, frames, units

Units are document units (mm), with f64 everywhere in core, as in 2D. The
world frame has Z up. The 2D drawing plane is world XY at z = 0, which makes
the plan view the natural default and lets a 2D floor plan sit under the 3D
model. `Placement` is a rigid transform (unit quaternion plus translation).
Scale is only allowed on assets. Parts use explicit dimensions, so cut lists
stay honest.

## 5. Kernel choice and boundary

### Decision

- **Primary backend: ogeom**, pinned to an exact version (`=0.10.x`). It was
  the only candidate that passed every smoke test: exact volume on booleans,
  a 12-edge fillet with corner blends followed by booleans that still yield
  a valid B-rep at the closed-form volume, built-in HLR (exact silhouettes
  and a mesh visibility test),
  section with hatch, and a pure wasm build with no imports.
- **Secondary backend: Truck** (crates.io 0.6/0.4), compiled in tests and
  behind a cargo feature. Every corpus part is evaluated on both, and the
  volumes, bounding boxes and projected outlines are compared. Disagreement
  is a test failure that points at one kernel or the other. Truck has no
  usable fillets, so roundover corpus entries only check ogeom against
  closed-form values.
- **Our own fast path for flat parts.** Cut lists, nominal dimensions and
  grain come straight from the feature tree (`PartKind::Flat`), with no
  kernel involved. The kernel's bounding box confirms them (and the check
  fails loudly if a feature pokes outside the declared thickness).

### Why not "our own parametric layer + mesh booleans" (the earlier recommendation)

The feature tree is still ours, as recommended. The mesh-boolean half is
dropped. Mesh booleans cannot give exact volumes, exact projected arcs or
real roundovers. csgrs no longer resolves from crates.io and fails
box-minus-cylinder on main. vcad shows what happens when mesh CSG is used
as a fallback: silent `TriangleSoup`. Truck was evaluated seriously, as the
brief suggested. It works and is the safe second backend, but its released
API has no roundovers, its booleans were about 30x slower than ogeom's on
the test part, and it has had no release for two years.

### Mitigating ogeom's risk

ogeom is about ten weeks old (repo created 2026-08-04, first release
2026-09-18), has one author and 4 stars, ships about 222 k
lines, and its structure and naming suggest heavy machine generation. A
competent dependency can still die. The plan:

1. **Trait boundary.** All kernel use goes through `SolidKernel` (below). No
   ogeom type leaks into the feature tree, the sync format or the API.
2. **Exact pin + vendoring right.** It is MIT/Apache-2.0, so if upstream
   disappears we vendor the crate set and maintain the subset we use
   (booleans, fillet, mesh, HLR). The maintainer is open to upstreaming
   fixes, and ogeom tracks its gaps in a public parity table, so fixes have
   a home.
3. **A differential corpus.** It runs in CI on both backends, natively and
   in wasm (rungs 3D0a/3D0b), so a regression from a version bump is caught before
   it reaches users.
4. **Swappable without migration.** Documents store feature trees, not
   kernel data, so switching backends never rewrites a document.

### The trait

```rust
pub trait SolidKernel {
    type Brep: Clone;
    fn evaluate(&self, def: &PartDef, tools: &dyn ToolResolver) -> Result<Evaluated<Self::Brep>, EvalError>;
    fn tessellate(&self, b: &Self::Brep, tol: Tess) -> Mesh;               // positions, normals, uv, face ids
    fn edges(&self, b: &Self::Brep, tol: Tess) -> Vec<EdgeCurve3>;         // for edge overlay + picking
    fn project(&self, parts: &[(&Self::Brep, Placement)], view: &ViewSpec) -> Drawing2d;
    fn section(&self, parts: &[(&Self::Brep, Placement)], plane: &Plane3) -> Vec<SectionRegion>;
    fn mass(&self, b: &Self::Brep) -> MassProps;                           // exact volume, centroid
    fn bbox(&self, b: &Self::Brep, frame: &Placement) -> Aabb3;
    fn distance(&self, a: &Self::Brep, b: &Self::Brep) -> f64;             // interference, measure3d
}

pub struct Evaluated<B> { pub brep: B, pub face_tags: Vec<FaceTag>, pub edge_tags: Vec<EdgeTag>,
                          pub degraded: Vec<Degradation> /* e.g. fillet fell back to Visual */ }
```

`FaceTag`/`EdgeTag` map kernel entities back to `(FeatId, role, seg)`. This
is how selection, hatching per part and cut-list face naming work without
kernel ids.

### Roundovers: exact first, visual fallback

The evidence says exact fillets are feasible: ogeom rounds all 12 edges of a
board and keeps booleans exact afterwards. So the default is
`RoundFallback::Error`, a real fillet in the B-rep. ogeom refuses rather
than guesses on interfering chains. For those, `fallback: "visual"` gives a
render-only bevel: the renderer smooths the edge normals and the mesh gets a
small bevel strip. `cad.project` then writes a 2D note ("R3 roundover, all
outer edges") on the view instead of an arc, and cut lists ignore roundovers
in either case. Every fallback is recorded in `Evaluated.degraded` and shown
by `cad.parts()`, so it is never silent.

## 6. Tessellation strategy and accuracy budget

| Quantity | Source | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Model geometry | feature tree, f64 mm | exact (analytic) |
| Kernel tolerance | ogeom `Tolerances::millimetres()` | linear confusion ~1e-7 mm scale (ogeom default) |
| Volume, centroid, distance, interference | kernel, exact surfaces | ≤ 1e-6 relative (corpus-checked against closed form) |
| Cut-list L x W x T | feature tree (flat parts) | exact numbers as entered; the kernel bbox must agree to 1e-6 mm |
| Projected 2D edges (lines, circles, ellipses) | analytic re-fit of the source edge (§7) | exact |
| Projected 2D edges (other curves, silhouettes of curved faces) | spline fit | ≤ 0.01 mm chordal |
| Hidden/visible split points | parameters on the exact edge, refined against the visibility oracle (§7.3) | ≤ 0.01 mm along the edge |
| Render mesh (viewport) | tessellation at runtime | chord ≤ 0.5 px at current zoom, angle ≤ 5° |
| Render mesh (path tracer / headless) | same, fixed for the shot | chord ≤ 0.25 px at output resolution |

Rules:

- **Tessellate only in the render path.** `cadview-render3d` asks core for
  `mesh(part, Tess { chord, angle })`. Core picks a tolerance bucket (powers
  of 2 between 0.005 mm and 2 mm) from the requested chord and caches by
  `(brep_hash, bucket)`. Zooming in past a bucket triggers re-tessellation
  of the visible parts within a per-frame time budget, so the frame never
  blocks. The coarser mesh is shown until the finer one is ready. This is
  the 3D analogue of the 2D BezPath cache.
- **Flat faces are free.** Planar faces tessellate exactly at any tolerance.
  For DIY furniture most triangles come from holes, roundovers and turned
  parts, which is where the zoom-adaptive bucket pays off. Smoke data: the
  rounded board is 3.5 k triangles at chord 0.1 mm and 65 k at 0.01 mm.
- **Evaluation is cached by content hash**, and only edited defs
  re-evaluate. Smoke timings: about 10 ms for a flat part with two cuts,
  about 1 s natively and 3 s in wasm for a fully rounded board. Evaluation
  therefore runs off the input path: in the browser it is time-sliced
  between frames, and fully rounded parts show their previous B-rep until
  the new one is ready. Moving evaluation into a Web Worker is an open
  question (§13).

## 7. 3D to 2D projection

`cad.project` writes ordinary 2D entities into the `Document`, so
dimensions, title block, PDF and DWG export work unchanged.

### 7.1 Views

`ViewSpec { dir, up, kind: Ortho | Iso | Section(plane), scale, at: [x, y], parts: filter, hidden: bool, tangent_edges: bool }`.
The standard names are `front`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` and
`iso`, with first- or third-angle arrangement chosen by option (ISO default:
first angle).

Each view becomes **one block definition** (`*V_<name>`) plus one
`BlockInsert` at `at`, with the scale applied in the insert. Re-projecting
replaces the block content and keeps the insert, so dimensions placed on the
sheet next to it remain, and stale ones are easy to spot. The block's
entities sit on standard layers:

| Layer | Content | Linetype / weight |
|---|---|---|
| `3D_VISIBLE` | visible edges and silhouettes | Continuous, 0.5 mm |
| `3D_HIDDEN` | hidden edges | Hidden, 0.25 mm |
| `3D_CENTER` | axes of revolved features and holes | Center, 0.18 mm |
| `3D_SECTION` | section outlines | Continuous, 0.5 mm |
| `3D_HATCH` | section hatch per material | Continuous, 0.18 mm |
| `3D_NOTES` | roundover notes, part labels | — |

### 7.2 Exact paths for prismatic and turned parts

The kernel's HLR returns runs of curves, each split into visible and hidden
pieces and tagged with its **source edge** (`ogeom::hlr::Source::Edge`). The
adapter re-fits each run analytically from the source edge's 3D curve and
the parameter interval of the run:

- a 3D line becomes a `Shape::Line`.
- a circle in a plane parallel to the view becomes a `Shape::Arc` or
  `Circle`.
- a circle in an oblique plane becomes a `Shape::Ellipse` (with params),
  which covers holes in an iso view and turned legs seen from above.
- a circle in a plane containing the view direction becomes a line.
- anything else (spline edges, silhouettes of cylinders, cones and tori)
  becomes a `Shape::Spline` fitted to ≤ 0.01 mm. Cylinder and cone
  silhouettes in principal views are lines, and the adapter detects and
  emits them as lines.

For the target domain (boards, dados, holes, turned legs) this means the DWG
contains real `LINE`, `ARC`, `CIRCLE` and `ELLIPSE` entities. That is
checkable, and rung 3D3a tests it.

### 7.3 Hidden lines, and how this fits the abstract-geometry rule

**Every emitted curve is an exact source curve.** HLR output is a set of
parameter intervals on exact 3D curves, mapped to 2D by §7.2. The curves
come from two sources:

- **Model edges.** These are lines, circles and B-splines from the B-rep.
- **Silhouettes of curved faces.** These are computed in closed form by
  ogeom's `exact` module (`hlr::exact::silhouettes`). For a cylinder or
  cone they are rulings (lines), and for a torus or a surface of
  revolution they are exact curves fitted as in §7.2.

The ogeom polygonal output (`DrawnCurve.points`, a polyline) and
silhouettes taken from mesh edges are **never written to the Document**.

**The mesh is only a visibility oracle.** The question "is the point at
parameter t of this edge hidden?" is answered by casting a ray toward the
eye against a fine tessellation (0.01 mm chord) of the placed parts. That
is fast and robust, and it is what ogeom's polygonal HLR does internally.
Each visibility change is located by bisection on the exact edge's
parameter, to 1e-4 mm along the edge. The emitted run is the exact curve
restricted to `[t0, t1]`. A mesh only ever decides *where* a line turns
dashed, to a stated tolerance. It never decides *what* the line is.

ogeom's `exact` visibility (asking the faces directly, no mesh) is the
fallback for oracle edge cases (near-grazing faces) and the cross-check
in the 3D3a corpus tests. Smoke test: the rounded board's front view gave
55 visible and 46 hidden curves in 9 ms with the polygonal path. When the
backend is Truck, the same oracle algorithm runs in our adapter
(`project.rs`) on Truck's mesh, with silhouettes from our own closed-form
code for planes, cylinders, cones and surfaces of revolution (enough for
the target domain). The algorithm is small and is ours, so the backend
never decides the look of a drawing.

**What the rule allows.** AGENTS.md says "never flatten, tessellate, or
triangulate at load time or in the API layer; flattening happens only
during rendering". The oracle tessellates inside an API call
(`cad.project`), but nothing tessellated is stored, synced or emitted, and
the result is exact geometry with a stated split tolerance. This design
treats the rule as covering **stored and emitted geometry**. A transient
mesh used as a numeric oracle is allowed, as long as it never becomes
output and its tolerance is documented. Proposed clarification for
AGENTS.md (not applied, for the maintainer to accept):

> Derived meshes may be used transiently inside an operation as a numeric
> oracle (visibility, ray picking, coarse interference pre-checks),
> provided the operation's stored or emitted geometry is still exact
> (source curves, split at refined parameters), its tolerance is
> documented, and the mesh is never synced or written to the document.

### 7.4 Sections and hatching

A section view cuts the placed parts with a plane through the kernel
(`section`), producing planar regions tagged by part. Each region becomes an
exact outline (arcs stay arcs) plus `addHatch` with the part material's
`section_hatch` (wood: lines at 45°, alternating per adjacent part; plywood:
the same plus a ply-direction note; concrete: the cross/stipple pattern;
steel: dense 45° lines). The part behind the plane is projected with HLR as
in 7.3. Section lines and labels ("A-A") on the parent view use the existing
`draft` helpers.

### 7.5 Dimensions on projected views

`cad.project` returns, for each view, a `toSheet(p3) -> [x, y]` mapping and
named anchors (`view.anchor(part, "bbox.min")`, `view.edge(part, sel)`).
Scripts then call the existing `cad.measure`, `dimRadius` and so on with
sheet coordinates. No new dimension system is needed.

### 7.6 Cut lists

`cad.cutList({ by: "material" })` walks `parts` and groups
`PartKind::Flat` parts by `(label, material, L, W, T)`. Two sides that differ
only by a drilled hole are one row with qty 2, and the per-part differences
go in the notes. It emits rows of
`{ label, qty, length, width, thickness, material, grain, notes }`. Length
follows the grain, and width is the other in-plane extent of the profile
bbox. Notes collect edge banding, roundovers and holes ("4x Ø5 shelf pins").
The numbers come from the feature tree and are confirmed against the kernel
bbox. `cad.cutListTable(rows, { at })` draws the table as 2D text and lines
next to the title block. Non-flat parts (turned legs) get a "stock" row
(blank size = bbox rounded up by a configurable allowance). Sheet nesting is
out of scope: rows can be exported as CSV through the returned JS array.

### 7.7 Interference and measure (the reality check)

The point of 3D here is to catch 2D mistakes, so two queries ship with the
projection rung:

- `cad.interference()` evaluates pairwise `common` volume between parts that
  are not deliberate joinery (a part that has a `Boolean{tool: Part}`
  against another is exempt for that pair). It returns
  `[{a, b, volume, bbox}]`. Typical catches: a shelf 2 mm too long for its
  dado, or a drawer that hits the frame.
- `cad.measure3d(a, b)` is the exact minimum distance between parts, faces
  or points.

## 8. Assets

- **Reference, not content.** `AssetRef.key` is a document-store key
  (`assets/polyhaven/<slug>/<slug>_2k.glb`). Assets sync as the ~150-byte
  `AssetRef`. Bytes come from `GET /api/files/<key>` (bearer token, cached,
  `ETag`). In single-file mode the server serves keys relative to the DWG's
  folder.
- **Excluded** from `cad.project`, `cad.cutList`, `cad.interference` and DWG
  export. JSON save keeps the reference.
- **Plan symbol.** `plan_symbol: Footprint` makes `cad.project` (top view)
  and the 2D plan show the asset's bbox outline with a light diagonal on
  layer `3D_ASSETS`. `Block(name)` places a user 2D block instead (a chair
  symbol). The plan symbol is generated, not stored. It is regenerated with
  the view.
- **Loading.** The `gltf` crate (1.4.1) is already a dependency of
  kiss3d 0.47, whose glTF loader handles meshes, PBR materials and textures.
  Assets are render-only, so they never enter the kernel.
- **Sourcing.** [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/license) models, HDRIs
  and textures are CC0. A `just fetch-assets` script downloads a pinned
  manifest (slug, resolution, sha256) into `assets/`, which is `.gitignore`d.
  Example scripts reference only manifest slugs, so a fresh clone runs
  `just fetch-assets` once. The site/Pages build fetches the same manifest.

## 9. Renderer architecture

### 9.1 Layers

```
 cadview-render3d
 ├── trait Renderer3d { sync(&Document), set_camera, set_mode, frame(&mut Target) -> FrameState }
 ├── KissBackend   (kiss3d 0.47: raster PBR + RayTracer + IBL + tonemap)
 ├── scene_sync.rs Document -> GPU scene: parts (core meshes, per-part material),
 │                 edges overlay (core edge curves, tessellated to 0.5 px), assets (glTF),
 │                 HDRI (store key), lights (sun from scene3d: date/latitude optional)
 ├── camera.rs     orbit/pan/zoom, ortho <-> perspective, named views, fit
 └── headless.rs   (native) OffscreenSurface -> PNG, fixed spp, deterministic seed
```

### 9.2 Modes

- **Shaded** (default, interactive): kiss3d's rasterizer with PBR, IBL from
  the scene HDRI, shadow maps, SSAO and MSAA. It is demand-driven like the
  2D renderer: zero frames when idle.
- **Lines**: exact part edges (tessellated to screen tolerance) over flat
  shading, hidden edges dashed. It is the on-screen twin of `cad.project`.
- **Render**: kiss3d `RayTracer` (compute BVH on WebGPU, HW ray query on
  native when available). It is progressive, accumulating `samples_per_frame`
  per frame while idle, and stops at the target spp (default 256 in the
  browser, 1024 headless). The denoiser runs on the final accumulation, and
  any camera move resets the accumulation. Rendering stops as soon as the
  target is reached, which keeps the zero-idle-frames property.

Tone mapping is AgX by default for renders and Khronos PBR Neutral for
Shaded mode (more faithful colours for checking materials). Exposure is an
EV value in `scene3d`.

### 9.3 Sharing the device with Vello

Today `vello_render.rs` creates a device per canvas (`init_gpu`). The plan
is to change that to **one `wgpu::Device` per page**, held in a small
`GpuContext` registry in `cadview-web` and handed to both Vello and
`kiss3d::context::Context::init` (compile-proven on wgpu 30). Each canvas
keeps its own surface. A 3D canvas renders kiss3d into an `OffscreenSurface`
and blits its `output_view` to the canvas with the same `TextureBlitter`
path Vello uses. Overlays (selection, dimensions-in-3D later) can be Vello
scenes composited over the 3D texture. One device means one place for
limits and features, and no cross-device texture copies.

Kiss3d keeps thread-local global managers. That is acceptable in a shell
crate (core keeps zero global state). Version 0.47 fixed the
"second `OffscreenSurface` replaces managers" bug, which matters for several
3D tabs. Rung 3D2c proves two 3D canvases at once.

### 9.4 Headless server-side rendering

`cadview-server` gets a `render` RPC (and the sandbox gets `cad.render()` as
an `rpc-call`). It runs `cadview-render3d::headless` natively: the same
scene sync, then a fixed spp, a fixed seed and a PNG. It is used for example
PNGs (960x640) and for agents to check their work visually. On a GPU-less
host, wgpu uses Vulkan through lavapipe. That is **unverified** (the research
machine had no Vulkan driver), and rung 3D6b must prove it in CI with a time budget.
Fallback: the existing headless-Chromium `render.mjs` path with WebGPU.

### 9.5 If the look gate fails

The maintainer found Kiss3d renders "dry". Most of that look usually comes
from content, not the integrator: no HDRI, a lone point light, low-albedo
default materials, a clamped tone map. Rung 3D5b sets up a reference scene
(bookshelf, Poly Haven HDRI, oak and plaster PBR textures) and compares it
against Blender Cycles with the same assets, using ꟻLIP as the metric. If
Kiss3d's tracer cannot reach the threshold, we fork its tracer kernel (WGSL,
BSD-3, about 1.7 k lines: BVH, BSDF, MIS, IBL, denoiser) into
`cadview-render3d/tracer/` and own it. We fix the BSDF and sampling there,
and keep Kiss3d (or a thin raster pass of our own) for Shaded mode. Either
way we do not write a tracer from scratch.

## 10. Scripting API sketch

New `cad_call` methods, exposed through `cad-api.ts`. All units are document
mm and all angles degrees, as in the 2D API. Every creation call returns the
created object with an `id`, and all mutations accept the usual target forms
(id, array, filtered objects).

```js
// Materials (presets carry PBR + section hatch + stock defaults)
cad.material("oak", { preset: "wood-oak", textures: "polyhaven:oak_veneer_01" })
cad.material("ply", { preset: "birch-ply" })

// Flat part: the DIY workhorse. profile = rectangle size, ring, or 2D entity ids
cad.board({ name, size: [w, l] | profile, thickness, plane: "xy"|"xz"|"yz"|{origin,normal,xdir},
            at: [x,y,z], material, grain: "length"|"width", layer })

// General features (return a part)
cad.extrude(profile, { plane, at, distance, taper, material, name })
cad.revolve(profile, { plane, axis: [[x0,y0],[x1,y1]], angle: 360, at, material, name })
cad.sweep(profile, path3d, { material, name })
cad.loft([{ profile, plane, at }, ...], { ruled: false, material, name })

// Modify (adds features to the part's def)
cad.subtract(part, tools, { keepTools: true, clearance: 0 })   // joinery
cad.union(part, tools); cad.intersect(part, tools)
cad.hole(part, { at, dir, dia, depth: "through" | mm, counterbore: [dia, depth] })
cad.pocket(part, profile, { plane, depth })                    // dado/rabbet as a profile cut
cad.roundover(part, { edges: "outer-top" | EdgeSel | points, r, fallback: "visual" })
cad.chamfer3d(part, { edges, d })

// Placement and queries
cad.move3d(target, [dx,dy,dz]); cad.rotate3d(target, deg, axis, about)
cad.copy3d(target, [dx,dy,dz], { shareDef: false }) // default: independent copy (own PartDef);
                                                    // shareDef: true = instance of the same def
cad.parts(filter?) // [{id, name, def, material, bbox, volume, kind, degraded}]
cad.measure3d(a, b) // exact min distance
cad.interference() // [{a, b, volume}]

// Assets
cad.placeAsset("assets/polyhaven/potted_plant_01/potted_plant_01_2k.glb",
               { at, rotate: deg, scale: 1, planSymbol: "footprint" | blockName | null })

// 3D -> 2D
const views = cad.project({ parts, views: ["front","left","top","iso"], at: [x,y], gap: 40,
                            scale: 1/10, hidden: true,
                            sections: [{ name: "A-A", plane: { origin, normal }, in: "front" }] })
// views.front.toSheet([x,y,z]) -> [sx, sy]; views.front.anchor(part, "bbox.max")
const rows = cad.cutList({ by: "material" })
cad.cutListTable(rows, { at: [x,y] })

// Rendering (client: viewport state; server/sandbox: headless RPC)
cad.view3d({ camera: { eye, target, fov }, hdri: "polyhaven:studio_small_09",
             exposure: 0, tonemap: "agx", mode: "shaded" | "lines" | "render" })
await cad.render({ out: "renders/bookshelf.png", size: [960, 640], spp: 1024 })
```

### 10.1 Worked example: a bookshelf

An 800 x 1800 x 300 mm oak bookshelf: two 18 mm sides with 6 mm-deep dados,
five shelves, a top that sits on the sides, and a 6 mm plywood back in a
rabbet. The script models
it, checks it, renders it with a plant beside it, projects a shop drawing
and emits a cut list. It is the target script for the 🎯 rung
(`examples/07-bookshelf.js`).

```js

```

Expected cut list (checked by hand, and a golden test in rung 3D3b):

| 1 | top | 800 | 300 | 18 | oak | R3 top edges |
| 1 | back | 1782 | 776 | 6 | ply | |

## 11. Crate layout

| Crate | Kind | Change | Targets |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cadview-core` | core | new `solid/` module (types, eval, kernel trait + `OgeomKernel`, `TruckKernel` behind the `kernel-truck` feature for tests, mesh cache, project, section, cutlist, check); `dispatch_3d.rs`; sync maps | wasm32 + native |
| `cadview-render` | shell-shared | new (LADDER-NATIVE N0b): the 2D Vello scene builder, camera, LOD and path cache, extracted from `cadview-web` | wasm32 + native |
| `cadview-render3d` | shell-shared | new: `Renderer3d` trait, Kiss3d backend, scene sync, camera, headless | wasm32 + native |
| `cadview-store` | shell-shared | new (LADDER-NATIVE N2b): `DocumentStore` trait, `SingleFileStore`, `FolderStore`, moved out of `cadview-server` | native |
| `cadview-web` | shell | `GpuContext` (one device per page), vello 0.9 → 0.11 and eframe/egui 0.34 → 0.36, 3D canvas start/stop, wasm exports | wasm32 |
| `cadview-server` | shell | `/api/files/<key>`, `/api/session`, `render` RPC, `cad.render` in the sandbox via `rpc-call`; uses `cadview-store` | native |
| `cadview-desktop` | shell | new (LADDER-NATIVE): eframe window, chrome, WT client, optional local sandbox | native |
| `web/src` | shell | `cad-api.ts` 3D methods, 2D/3D toggle per tab in `ViewportContainer`, part list in the layer panel | TS |
| `examples/` | — | `07-bookshelf.js`, `08-turned-stool.js`, `assets.manifest.json` | — |

**Why shell-shared crates don't break core-first.** The rule says CAD logic
goes in core, and web and server stay thin. `cadview-render` and
`cadview-render3d` exist only because their code is **GPU-bound**: wgpu,
Vello, Kiss3d and shaders. That code cannot go in core, which must stay
GPU-free so the server and sandbox can use it without a graphics stack.
Without these crates it would be duplicated in two shells (web and
desktop). `cadview-store` is the same case for filesystem access (server
and desktop). These crates hold **no CAD logic**. They read the `Document`
and core-computed data (meshes, edge curves, tessellation buckets, scene
settings) and turn them into pixels, or bytes into documents. Any decision
about geometry (what a part is, how it projects, what the cut list says,
which tolerance applies) stays in core. A review checklist item enforces
it: no `cadview-core` types are constructed or mutated in these crates
except through `cad_call` or core's public query functions.

## 12. Risks

- **ogeom maturity and bus factor.** Mitigations in §5: trait, pin,
  differential corpus, vendoring right, kernel-free documents.
- **Evaluation latency in the browser.** Fully rounded parts took seconds
  in wasm in the smoke test. Caching, time-slicing and possibly a worker
  (§13) handle it. Rung 3D0b records per-corpus-part timings native and wasm.
- **Kiss3d fit.** Global thread-local managers, an engine-shaped API and the
  "dry" look. The trait boundary plus the 3D5b look gate with a fork fallback
  bound the risk.
- **wgpu major bumps across Vello, Kiss3d and egui.** They are aligned on
  wgpu 30 today and will drift. Pin all three and bump together. The single
  `GpuContext` makes a mismatch a compile error, not a runtime surprise.
- **Headless rendering without a GPU** (lavapipe) is unproven here. It could
  be too slow for 1024 spp. Fallbacks: fewer spp plus the denoiser, a
  GPU-enabled runner for releases, or the Chromium path.
- **wasm size** grows by about 3.2 MB for the kernel and a few MB for
  Kiss3d. That is acceptable against today's 24 MB, but rungs 3D0b and 3D2a record it.
- **Floating-point divergence between peers** (wasm vs native) in kernel
  results. Nothing synced depends on it (§4.2). Projections are written
  once by one peer.

## 13. Open questions

1. Should evaluation run in a Web Worker (a second wasm instance with its
   own `Document` replica fed by Yrs updates)? That would keep the UI fluid
   for heavy parts but doubles memory. Decide after rung 3D0b timings.
2. STEP export of parts (ogeom and Truck both write STEP), for CNC shops.
   It is cheap to expose. Should it be a rung or a one-liner later?
3. Should a section's hatch respect wood grain direction per part
   (end grain vs long grain), as some furniture-drawing conventions do?
4. Do turned parts (revolve) get a lathe-style "turning drawing" with
   diameters at stations as a projection option?
5. Should DWG export of 3D be supported, as 3DSOLID/ACIS via acadrust? That
   is likely never, since the 2D projection is the deliverable. This
   confirms the non-goal.
6. Should Kiss3d's HW ray-query backend be used on native desktop
   (LADDER-NATIVE) by default? It makes renders faster and gives the same
   images in principle. Verify equivalence in 3D5b.
