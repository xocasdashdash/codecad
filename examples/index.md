# CodeCAD examples

Twelve drawings made with the CodeCAD JavaScript API, each saved as a DWG
and rendered from that DWG. They are meant to read like a draftsperson's
sheets: drafting conventions (centre lines, sections and hatching,
ISO-style dimensions), layers with ByLayer colours, linetypes and
lineweights, and a shared border and title block.

How they were made: each script was written by an AI agent and refined
over several passes. After every pass the agent rendered the saved DWG,
looked at the PNG, and fixed clipping, overlaps and drafting mistakes.
The scripts are not single-shot.

Shared code lives in [`lib/drafting.js`](lib/drafting.js). It covers what
the API doesn't do natively: paper-scaled layers and linetypes, the sheet
border and title block, leaders, centre marks and tables. Everything else
uses native `cad.*` calls. Colours are ACI palette indices, so DWG
save/reload is lossless.

## Reproducing

```bash
# server + a static server for the headless renderer (repo root)
RUST_LOG=info target/release/cadview-server ./examples/
python3 -m http.server 8790 -d .
# build the embeddable viewer once: cd web && pnpm exec vite build --config vite.embed.config.ts

# run script -> save DWG -> render PNG (960x640) from the saved DWG
bash examples/lib/export.sh 01-flange-plate 02-fibonacci-spiral ...
```

`export.sh` runs each script on a fresh server document through
`POST /api/run`, saves `examples/NN-name.dwg` with `cad.saveDwg`, then
`lib/render.mjs` loads that DWG in headless Chromium through
`<codecad-viewer>`. The PNG therefore also checks the DWG round trip.
